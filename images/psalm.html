<h1>Psalm 23</h1>

<div id="psalm-content">
  The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.<br>
  He makes me lie down in green pastures.<br>
  He leads me beside still waters.<br>
  He restores my soul.<br>
  He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.<br>
  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br>
  I will fear no evil, for you are with me;<br>
  your rod and your staff, they comfort me.<br>
  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;<br>
  you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.<br>
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,<br>
  and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
