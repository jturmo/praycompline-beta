        Be present, O&nbsp;merciful God, and protect us through the hours of
        this night, so that we who are wearied by the changes and chances of
        this life may rest in your eternal changelessness; through
        Jesus&nbsp;Christ&nbsp;our&nbsp;Lord. <strong>Amen.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        O God, your unfailing providence sustains the world we live in and the
        life we live: Watch over those, both night and day, who work while
        others sleep, and grant that we may never forget that our common life
        depends upon each other's toil; through Jesus&nbsp;Christ our Lord.
        <strong>Amen.</strong>
