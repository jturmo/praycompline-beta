      <p>
        Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this
        night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick,
        Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the
        suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your
        love's sake. <strong>Amen.</strong>
